  "subtitle": "A detailed explanation of the protocol behind decentralized, censorship-resistant communication",
  "nostr_intro": "Nostr (Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays) is a minimalist, censorship-resistant communication protocol based on the idea of transmitting messages (events) through a decentralized network of relays. It eliminates central dependencies using cryptographic mechanisms and offers robust, extensible structures for various use cases—from social media platforms to decentralized marketplaces.",
  "protocol_basics": "Basics",
  "protocol_basics_intro": "The protocol is built around the simple idea of events, transmitted using a standardized JSON structure. An event is the atomic unit containing all the information needed for processing and validation. This provides a fully interoperable and extensible foundation.",
  "event_structure": {
    "title": "Structure of an Event",
    "id_desc": "The event ID is generated as a SHA-256 hash of the serialized content. This ensures each event is unique and immutable.",
    "pubkey_desc": "The public key of the sender serves as an identifier and enables signature verification.",
    "created_at_desc": "A Unix timestamp indicating when the event was created. This is essential for chronological ordering and conflict resolution between competing events.",
    "kind_desc": "The event type (kind) is a numeric value describing the purpose and processing of the event (e.g., 1 for text messages, 0 for profile data).",
    "tags_desc": "An array of key-value pairs containing metadata such as references to other events, public keys, or URLs. Tags significantly extend the functionality of events.",
    "content_desc": "The actual content of the event, typically plain text or a JSON data structure. This content is unencrypted unless the event is meant for private communication.",
    "sig_desc": "The digital signature, created using the sender’s private key, validates the event’s authenticity. It is a cornerstone of the protocol’s censorship-resistant design."

They extend the core functionalities of the protocol without compromising basic compatibility. Each type of event is classified by its kind value, providing a semantic basis for interpreting the event."
