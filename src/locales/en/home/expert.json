  "subtitle": "The protocol behind decentralized, censorship-resistant communication explained in detail",
  "nostr_intro": "Nostr (Notes and Other Stuff Transmitted by Relays) is a minimalist, censorship-resistant communication protocol based on the idea of distributing messages (events) through a decentralized network of relays. It eliminates central dependencies through cryptographic mechanisms and offers robust, extensible structures for various use cases - from social media platforms to decentralized marketplaces.",
  "protocol_basics": "Basics",
  "protocol_basics_intro": "The protocol is based on the simple idea of events sent through a standardized JSON structure. An event is an atomic unit that contains all the information necessary for processing and validation, creating a fully interoperable and extensible foundation.",
  "event_structure": {
    "title": "Structure of a Message",
    "id_desc": "The ID of an event is generated as a SHA-256 hash of the serialized content. This mechanism ensures that each message is unique and immutable.",
    "pubkey_desc": "The sender's public key serves as an identifier and enables signature verification.",
    "created_at_desc": "A Unix timestamp indicating the creation time of the event. It is essential for temporal ordering and conflict resolution in competing events.",
    "kind_desc": "The type of the event (kind) is a numerical value that describes the meaning and processing of the event (e.g., 1 for text messages, 0 for profile data).",
    "tags_desc": "An array of key-value pairs that can contain metadata such as references to other events, public keys, or URLs. Tags significantly extend the functionality of events.",
    "content_desc": "The actual content of the event, typically as free text or JSON data structure. This content is not encrypted unless the event is intended for private communication.",
    "sig_desc": "The digital signature is generated with the sender's private key and validates the authenticity of the event. It is an integral part of the censorship-resistant design."
